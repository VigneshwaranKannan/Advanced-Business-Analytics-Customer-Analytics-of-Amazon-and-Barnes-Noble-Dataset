The dataset comprises of 40,000 purchase records from 2007 of both Barnes & Noble and Amazon. We created a customer analysis model to determine consumer purchasing preference using Base SAS. We started with basic pre-processing, built and improvised the model and concluded with managerial findings.
Our analysis includes the below points:
•	We started with basic data pre-processing like imputing the missing values Base SAS code.
•	We generated a count dataset to identify total number of purchases made by a single user.
•	We ran different models such as NBD model, Poisson Regression model, NBD Regression model and compared them to identify the model which gave better results. We used LR test to determine the same.
•	Improved the model by creating a new variable, also by trying interaction effects between variables and reported the results. 
•	We used logistic regression to find out why certain customers preferred Amazon over BN, upon which we summarized and reported the managerial findings.
